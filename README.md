# Minimal Steiner Tree Problem
ðŸ”¹ Project Description

This project focuses on the Minimum Steiner Tree Problem (STP) â€“ a classical NP-hard problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization.
The goal is to find the minimum-weight subgraph that connects all terminal nodes of a given graph, possibly including additional (Steiner) nodes.

The project explores different approaches to solving the problem, ranging from exact methods to metaheuristics:

-Brute Force 

-Tabu Search
